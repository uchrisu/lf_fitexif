# lf_fitexif
Create lenfun profile from exif-data from the raw files.

Currently works only for Sony-E (and tested only with full frame).
Use same directory structure as described in https://wilson.bronger.org/lens_calibration_tutorial/ (i.e. distortion, tca, vignetting) and simply run the script. 
Don't forget to fill in the manufacturer. 

Script will be improved soon - when I will find some time
